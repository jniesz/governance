This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the
L3AF open source project, which has been established as L3AF Project a Series of LF Projects, LLC (the “Project”).

## 1. Mission and Scope of the Project

<ol type="a">
   <li>The mission of the project is to empower the Linux kernel networking eBPF community by providing a cloud and vendor agnostic platform to orchestrate eBPF programs into the kernel, thereby enabling an eco-system that delivers Kernel Function As A Service.</li>
   <li>L3AF develops pure software-based solutions to implement eBPF programs that have the capability to instrument, inspect and interdict traffic; as well as provide enhanced performance observability. The open-source software developed within the project will leverage OSI-approved licenses. The scope of the Project includes but is not limited to:
      <ol type="i">
         <li>Enabling member communities to align on the design, architecture and implementation requirements to orchestrate eBPF programs into the kernel</li>
         <li>Developing an integrated, tested and validated Kernel Function eco- system, that can be leveraged and contributed to by the open-source community</li>
         <li>Supporting open source eBPF communities, which includes influencing upstream projects</li>
         <li>Supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the L3AF project.</li>
      </ol>
