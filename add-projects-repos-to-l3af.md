# Adding projects/repositories to the l3af-project organisation

This document outlines the process for adding a new project to the [l3af-project GitHub organisation](https://github.com/l3af-project). This is intended to be an initial and lightweight process which can be changed and expanded later as needed. If changes _are_ needed, please [open an issue in the governance repo](https://github.com/l3af-project/governance/issues/new) then add the issue to the [agenda for a TSC meeting](https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/display/L3AF/Meeting+Minutes).

## Definitions, constraints, etc.

For the sake of this document, "project" will be synonymous with "git repository" or "git repositories" if required by the project. "Project", "repo", and "repository" will be used interchangeably.

All repositories under the [l3af-project GitHub organisation](https://github.com/l3af-project) must be related in some way to the L3AF project.

## Process

All L3AF repos must be approved and added by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). Here's how we go about doing that.

1. Ask TSC for repo
    * Include list of committers for the repo
1. TSC approves (or denies; in which case this process ends)
1. TSC member (or someone w/approved access) creates repo, adds CODEOWNERS file, sets up team w/same members as CODEOWNERS, adds barebones README.md
